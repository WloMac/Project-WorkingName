# Project - Your Local

## User story:

As a news-hungry individual who is always on the go, I want to have access to a website with an API that provides me with the latest local news, entertainment, and weather updates based on my current location. This way, I can stay informed about what's happening around me and plan my day accordingly, without having to search for information from multiple sources. The website should be user-friendly, and the API should be easy to use and integrate into my other applications.

# API's
